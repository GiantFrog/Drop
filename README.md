# Drop
My version of the LibGDX wiki's drop game tutorial, which can be found at https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game.

## How to Run
### Windows
All you need to do is run Drop.exe! It will still make a leaderboard file in the directory you store it in.
### All Platforms
Download the file 'desktop-1.0.jar' from the folder 'desktop/build/libs'. You may move and rename this file as you wish. It will create a single leaderboard file wherever it is located.
To run the game, open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory you stored the jar in, and run the command 'java -jar desktop-1.0.jar'.
