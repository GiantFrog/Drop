# Drop
My version of the LibGDX wiki's drop game tutorial, which can be found at https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game. Now featuring online leaderboard functionality!

## How to Run
### Windows
Download Drop.exe and run! You need a Java runtime installed to play.
### Android
Download 'Drop.apk' to your phone. Open it from your phone using a file explorer and run to install. When done, you can delete the apk file and just launch the app like any other.
### All Platforms
Download the file 'Drop.jar'. You may move and rename this file as you wish. To run the game, open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory you stored the jar in, and run the command 'java -jar Drop.jar'.
