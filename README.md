# Drop
My version of the LibGDX wiki's drop game tutorial, which can be found at https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game.

NOTE: The android version is currently bugged and will crash when trying to connect to the leaderboard!

## How to Run
### Windows
Download Drop.exe and run! You need a Java runtime installed to play. The leaderboard is now shared online!
### Android
Download 'android-release.apk' to your phone. Open it from your phone using a file explorer and run to install. When done, you can delete the apk file and just launch the app like any other.
### All Platforms
Download the file 'desktop-1.0.jar' from the folder 'desktop/build/libs'. You may move and rename this file as you wish. To run the game, open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory you stored the jar in, and run the command 'java -jar desktop-1.0.jar'.
